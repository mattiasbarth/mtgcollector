# mtgcollector
A [Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en/magic-gameplay) card collection application built in Python.

## About
As a collector of MTG cards I want to have to organise my collection. While I use different online services I wanted to build my own local offline solution.
#### Initial features
* User can add card to collection
* Card data is fetched with an API and stored locally
* User can browse collection based on card name (and optionally expansion)
